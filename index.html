		<p>
			I'm a software developer living in Baltimore. I moved here with my girlfriend Katy after finishing my undergraduate degree at Rugers University. I work for the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CERDEC">US Army's <abbr title="Communications Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center">CERDEC</abbr></a> at <a href="http://www.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Aberdeen+Proving+Ground,+MD&amp;aq=&amp;sll=37.0625,-95.677068&amp;sspn=51.841773,114.169922&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Aberdeen+Proving+Ground,+Harford,+Maryland&amp;z=13&amp;iwloc=A">Aberdeen Proving Grounds, MD</a>. My responsibilities include developing prototype command and control tactical applications for soldiers.

			I constantly strive to learn more about my trade and stay with the rapidly changing software world.
			I'm using this space on the interwebs to learn, practice web development, maintain an email address, host my projects, and paste my <a href="/resume.html">resume</a> somewhere.
