Their false positive claim sent me down the rabbit hole of\nresearching what we called ‚ÄúJava XML Hell‚Äù. This research ultimately resulted in\na change to <a href=\"https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html\">OWASP‚Äôs XXE Cheat\nSheet</a>.\nIt turns out that securing JAXB against XXE attacks is really difficult, and the\nContrast Java agent accurately reported the application to be vulnerable üôå.</p>\n<p>Before accepting our proposed changes, the OWASP XXE Cheat Sheet advised OpenJDK\n1.8 users that their JAXB applications are safe from XXE attacks. The advice\nread:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Since JDK-8010393, which is in OpenJDK 8 beta 86,\n<code class=\"language-text\">javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller</code> instances are safe by default. The other classes\nmentioned here are still unsafe by default in Java 8.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>While researching this issue, I discovered that an application parsing untrusted\nXML on an OpenJDK 1.8 runtime may be vulnerable to XXE when:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the JAXB runtime has been inadvertently replaced with a different JAXB runtime\nthat is not safe-by-default (e.g. EclipseLink MOXy)</li>\n<li>the secure SAX parser that the OpenJDK 1.8 <code class=\"language-text\">Unmarshaller</code> uses has been\ninadvertently replaced with a different implementation that is not\nsafe-by-default (e.g. xercesImpl:2.8.0)</li>\n<li>the application uses one of the <code class=\"language-text\">unmarshal</code> overloads that does not delegate XML\nparsing to the safe-by-default SAX parser</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Given all of these caveats, I do not think that OpenJDK 1.8 users should assume\nthat their JAXB <code class=\"language-text\">Unmarshaller</code> is safe from XXE attacks by default.</p>\n<p>Contrast Security <a href=\"https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/xml-xxe-pitfalls-with-jaxb\">published my research to its Security Influencer‚Äôs\nblog</a>,\nand <a href=\"https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/488\">OWASP accepted my change\nrequest</a> to remove the\nmisleading guidance from its XXE Cheat Sheet.</p>\n<p>This is not the first time I have written about securing XML and Java.
