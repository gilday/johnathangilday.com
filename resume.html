				<div class="event-body">
					<p>CERDEC's public affairs office put us in touch with the Army Times to talk about the Tactical Marketplace platform we are building. There's nothing I can do about the paywall, but if you are an Army Times subscriber, you can check out the article <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/prime/2012/06/PRIMEarmy-platform-orders-via-smartphone-062512/">here</a></p>

					<h3>CERDEC Software Development Workshop</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="event-body">
					<p>I took an opportunity to speak to my colleagues at CERDEC's Software Development Workshop. I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD, its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience an example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee">Jesse Dee</a> and tried to make my slides stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but you can <a href="#">download them here</a></p>

					<h3>Co-authored paper for Army Science Conference</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="event-body">
					<p>Co-authored a paper with my teammates for the 2008 Army Science Conference. The paper describes a research effort we undertook to develop a multi-touch, multi-user system to facilitate face to face collaboration in a command and control environment. <a href="www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA503423">I'll let the paper speak for itself</a>. This research effort was a good experience for me: I got to work closely with a lot of smart engineers on the prototype and I worked closely with the users to develop the application layer and make adaptations based on their immediate feedback. I learned a lot about what it takes to make simple, intuitive user inerfaces. In 2010, our team received CERDEC's Employee of the Year award (team category)</p>
