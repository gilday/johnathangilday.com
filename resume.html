				<p>CERDEC's public affairs office put us in touch with the Army Times to talk about the Tactical Marketplace platform we are building. There's nothing I can do about the paywall, but if you are an Army Times subscriber, you can check out the article <a href="http://www.armytimes.com/prime/2012/06/PRIMEarmy-platform-orders-via-smartphone-062512/">here</a></p>

				<h3>CERDEC Software Development Workshop</h3>
			</div>
			<div class="event-body">
				<p>I took an opportunity to speak to my colleagues at CERDEC's Software Development Workshop. I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD, its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience a contrived example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee">Jesse Dee</a> and tried to make my slides stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but you can <a href="#">download them here</a></p>
