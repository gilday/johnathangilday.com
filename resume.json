TacMark is a web based system capable of delivering software, configuration, and data to soldiers' mobile devices. The TacMark prototype successfully demonstrated how a modular software marketplace is flexible enough to keep up with the rapid pace of the mobile device landscape and ensure that soldiers' mobile devices stay mission-ready.</p><p>CERDEC's public affairs office put us in touch with the Army Times to talk about the Tactical Marketplace platform we built.

I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD, its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience an example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee\">Jessee Dee</a> and tried to make my slides stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but I'll post them when they're cleared for release."

The paper describes a research effort we undertook to develop a multi-touch, multi-user system to facilitate face to face collaboration in a command and control environment. This research effort was a good experience for me: I got to work closely with a lot of smart engineers on the prototype pictured here; I also worked closely with the users to develop the application layer and make adaptations based on their immediate feedback. I learned a lot about what it takes to make simple, intuitive user interfaces. In 2010, our team received CERDEC's Employee of the Year award (team category)"
