In Fall 2012, I enrolled in Johns Hopkins University's Engineering Program for Professionals where I can study towards my masters degree part time. I am studying Computer Science again with a concentration in Software Enginnering. I enjoy the software engineering process and the complex problems it aims to solve so I'm looking forward to my coursework.
