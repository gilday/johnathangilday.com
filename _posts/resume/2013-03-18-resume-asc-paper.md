Co-authored a paper with my teammates for the 2008 Army Science Conference. The paper describes a research effort we undertook to develop a multi-touch, multi-user system to facilitate face to face collaboration in a command and control environment. <a href="www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA503423">I'll let the paper speak for itself</a>. This research effort was a good experience for me: I got to work closely with a lot of smart engineers on the prototype pictured here; I also worked closely with the users to develop the application layer and make adaptations based on their immediate feedback. I learned a lot about what it takes to make simple, intuitive user interfaces. In 2010, our team received CERDEC's Employee of the Year award (team category)
