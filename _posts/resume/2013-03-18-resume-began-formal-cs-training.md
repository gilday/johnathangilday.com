In 2002, I began my formal computer science training as a freshman at Red Bank Regional High School. I enrolled in a program RBR HS called the Academy of Information Technology which put me on a track to IT and programming electives each semester until graduation. My graduation class was the last to be taught Pascal in our introduction to programming class (I believe it's all Java now).
