In high school, I was fortunate enough to have access to interesting technology electives. One of the electives, taught by the fantastic Mandy Galante, prepped my classmates and me for the CompTIA Security+ exam which I passed at the end of the semester. Thanks to Mrs. Galante nominating me, I also received the CompTIA Merit Award from the CompTIA Educational Foundation.
