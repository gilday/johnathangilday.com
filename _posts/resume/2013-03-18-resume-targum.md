[The Daily Targume](http://www.dailytargum.com/) is Rutgers University's official student newspaper and the second oldest student newspaper in the United States. While at Rutgers, I started working at the Online desk  helping to publish the paper's articles online and bring new, exclusive online content to DailyTargum.com. During my time at the Targum, the paper's Online desk expanded and my peers elected me to fill the newly formed Associate Online Editor position.
