I siezed an opportunity to speak to my colleagues at CERDEC's Software Development Workshop. I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD, its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience an example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee">Jesse Dee</a> and tried to make my slides stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but I'll post them when they're cleared for release.
