In the summer of 2005, as an incoming high school senior, I started my internship at US Army Communications Electronics Research and Development Engineering Center. I returned to CERDEC each break I had from school until I graduated college and accepted a full time position at CERDEC. My mixture of academic study and apprenticeship (and later employment) at CERDEC has been an invaluable experience.
