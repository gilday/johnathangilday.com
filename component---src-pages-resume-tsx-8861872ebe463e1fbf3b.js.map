In\n                    February 2018, I stepped away from backend service\n                    development and took on the job of Principal Engineer for\n                    Contrast's Java agent team.</p>\n                    <p>\n                    Developing a Java agent is a challenging problem.\n                    Developing an agent which instruments low-level Java APIs\n                    for secure data flow analysis, as Contrast does, is even\n                    more difficult! Performance is always a first-class\n                    concern. Testing Java agents has its own unique challenges.\n                    This is an exciting project to work on.</p>\n                </div>\n            </article>\n            <article class=\"event\">\n                <span class=\"arrow\"></span>\n                <div class=\"heading\">\n                    <h3>Hello, Contrast Security</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"event-body\">\n                    <div class=\"photo\">\n                        <img alt=\"Contrast Security's office at Natty Boh Tower in Baltimore\" src=\"{{ asset('img/resume/boh-tower.jpg') }}\">\n                    </div>\n                    <p>In March 2017 I left Next Century to join Contrast\n                        Security: an application security start-up in Baltimore.\n                        Contrast is an exciting start-up to work for because\n                        their product has a unique approach to detecting and\n                        preventing vulnerabilities by instrumenting customers'\n                        applications at runtime.

TacMark is a web based system capable of delivering software, configuration, and data to soldiers' mobile devices. The TacMark prototype successfully demonstrated how a modular software marketplace is flexible enough to keep up with the rapid pace of the mobile device landscape and ensure that soldiers' mobile devices stay mission-ready.</p><p>CERDEC's public affairs office put us in touch with the Army Times to talk about the Tactical Marketplace platform we built.

I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD, its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience an example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from <a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/jessedee\">Jessee Dee</a> and tried to make my slides stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but I'll post them when they're cleared for release.</p>\n                </div>\n            </article>\n            \n            <article class=\"event\">\n                <span class=\"arrow\"></span>\n                <div class=\"heading\">\n                    <h3>Graduated from Rutgers University</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"event-body\">\n                    <div class=\"photo\">\n                        <img alt=\"graduation photo\" src=\"{{ asset('img/resume/graduation.jpg') }}\">\n                    </div>\n                    <p>Graduated with the last class of Rutgers College (now School of Arts and Sciences) with a B.S. in Computer Science and a minor in Economics (GPA 3.3).

The paper describes a research effort we undertook to develop a multi-touch, multi-user system to facilitate face to face collaboration in a command and control environment. This research effort was a good experience for me: I got to work closely with a lot of smart engineers on the prototype pictured here; I also worked closely with the users to develop the application layer and make adaptations based on their immediate feedback. I learned a lot about what it takes to make simple, intuitive user interfaces. In 2010, our team received CERDEC's Employee of the Year award (team category)</p>\n                </div>\n            </article>\n            \n            <article class=\"event\">\n                <span class=\"arrow\"></span>\n                <div class=\"heading\">\n                    <h3>Associate Online Editor, Daily Targum</h3>\n                </div>\n                <div class=\"event-body\">\n                    <p><a href=\"http://www.dailytargum.com\">The Daily Targum</a> is Rutgers University's official student newspaper and the second oldest student newspaper in the United States.
