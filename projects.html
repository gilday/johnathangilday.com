				PowerHour Pro is my experiment in the Android marketplace.
				After some experience with a G1, I fell in love with the platform and wanted to jump on the Android train.
				I was in college at the time so I couldn't justify the extra expense of a smart phone; so, I decided to make an application that will pay for my hobby.
				PowerHour Pro is that application. A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_hour">power hour</a> is a drinking game my roommates and I played in college.
				It consists of gathering around a stereo and drinking about a shot of beer every minute for an hour.
				The stereo plays 60 one minute clips, and when the song changes, the participants take their drink.
				Inspired by an iTunes plugin, iPowerhour, I decided to bring this capability to Android.
				I no longer do enough development on this app so I've released it for free on the Android market.
				After some more refactorings to the foundation of the app, I'm going to open it to the open source community on Github for additional development.

				As a proper geek right of passage, I'm seeing how much of my home computing I can port to open source Linux solutions.
				I've set my laptop up with Ubuntu and I'm able to do everything I could ask for from any platform.
				My linux home theater PC is another story. This machine has been an uphill battle trying to get all the media solutions I'd like.
				It's running Xbmcbuntu right now and getting things such as audio over HDMI is a royal pain.
				For all my labor I still can't have Netflix on the thing since Neflix won't support the platform.
				If I find a proper solution to this HTPC, I'll have to blog about it.
