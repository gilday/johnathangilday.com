title: Associate Online Editor, Daily Targum

[The Daily Targum](https://www.dailytargum.com) is Rutgers University's official
student newspaper and the second oldest student newspaper in the United States.
While at Rutgers, I started working at the Online desk helping to publish the
paper's articles online and bring new, exclusive online content to
DailyTargum.com. During my time at the Targum, the paper's Online desk expanded
and my peers elected me to fill the newly formed Associate Online Editor
position.
