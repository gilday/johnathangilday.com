In winter 2012, I left CERDEC to start a new chapter with
[Next Century Corporation](http://nextcentury.com) (acquired by CACI in 2019) as
a Senior Software Engineer. Next Century is an exciting place to work and truly
prides itself on its commitment to its values and purpose. I started as part of
the agile development team for the open source
[Ozone Widget Framework](https://owfgoss.org) project.
