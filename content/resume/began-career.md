title: Began my formal computer science training
---

In 2002, I began my formal computer science training as a freshman at Red Bank
Regional High School. I enrolled in a program RBR HS called the Academy of
Information Technology which put me on a track to IT and programming electives
each semester until graduation. My graduation class was the last to be taught
Pascal in our introduction to programming class (I believe it's all Java now).
