In Fall 2012, I enrolled in Johns Hopkins University's Engineering Program for
Professionals to study towards my Masters degree part time. I studied Computer
Science again with a concentration in Software Enginnering. I enjoy the software
engineering process and the complex problems it aims to solve so I'm looking
forward to my coursework.
