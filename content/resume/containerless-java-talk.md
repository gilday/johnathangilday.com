In July 2016, I volunteered to present Container-less Java Services at Next
Century's developer tech talk series. After working with Akka's "microkernel"
and deploying a web project to Heroku for school, I became increasingly
interested in Java services which run without the aid of an app server, so I was
happy to share this with my colleagues. The deck is available on
[speakerdeck.com/gilday/container-less-java-services](https://speakerdeck.com/gilday/container-less-java-services).
