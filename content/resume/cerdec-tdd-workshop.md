![TDD presentation slide](./tdd-slide.png)

I siezed an opportunity to speak to my colleagues at CERDEC's Software
Development Workshop. I spoke about Test Driven Development; a software
development process I have grown fond of using. After a quick talk about TDD,
its benefits, and what the process looks like, I demonstrated to the audience an
example where I added a new feature to an API the TDD way. The US Army is
notoriously guilty of death by PowerPoint, so I took a page from
[Jessee Dee](https://www.slideshare.net/jessedee) and tried to make my slides
stand out. I haven't adapted the slides to read well without my soundtrack, but
I'll post them when they're cleared for release.
