In September 2016, I started a new project! I spent several weeks finishing an
Angular 1.x single page app built with webpack. Next, I did some devops work
using Ansible to configure a set of OpenStack VMs with a suite of docker
containers integrated with docker-compose. Lately, I have been working on
replacing a legacy service with a Node.js app.
