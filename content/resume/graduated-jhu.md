title: More Next Century Projects
---

Next Century affords me many opportunities to migrate between projects and gain
a variety of experience with secure system development. I've worked on several
projects including a suite of cross-domain solutions, a customer collection
filtering system, and an enterprise data service.

While supporting these projects, some notable components I worked on includes

- Cloud infrastructure automation with OpenStack and Ansible<
- User log analysis with Apache NiFi
- Backend services in Python and Go
- A Web dashboard written with AngularJS and D3
- Java and Scala web services serving data from Berkeley DB JE
- Scaling and tuning a Cassandra cluster
