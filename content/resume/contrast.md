![Contrast Security's office at Natty Boh Tower in Baltimore](./boh-tower.jpg)

In March 2017 I left Next Century to join
[Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/): an application security
start-up in Baltimore. Contrast's product takes a unique approach to detecting
and preventing vulnerabilities by instrumenting customers' applications at
runtime.

In my first role at Contrast, I worked on building our backend product. I built
cloud native data analytics to support business intelligence and marketing
campaigns. I streamlined and automated the CI and deployment process. I expanded
testing practices and introduced static analysis code quality tools.
