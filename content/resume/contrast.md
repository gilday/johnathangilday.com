In March 2017 I left Next Century to join Contrast Security: an application
security start-up in Baltimore. Contrast is an exciting start-up to work for
because their product has a unique approach to detecting and preventing
vulnerabilities by instrumenting customers' applications at runtime. On previous
projects at Next Century, I developed an appreciation for devops workflows and
automating everything; Contrast's product introduces security to these workflows
in a way other tools do not. At Contrast, I work on scaling our backend product,
building cloud native data analytics, our automated test and release pipeline,
and our Java agent product.
