During my sophomore year, I worked as a field technician for the Rutgers
University Office of Information Technology. I was sent to students' dorms to
troubleshoot connectivity issues with the Rutgers network.

I don't love troubleshooting IT issues, so I was happy to leave this job and
take a position at The Daily Targum. The Daily Targum is the oldest daily
studen-run newspaper in the United States. I helped to run dailytargum.com. My
peers at the Targum elected me to the newly created Associate Online Editor
position.
