In 2018, I took an opportunity to speak to the
[Orange County Java User Group](https://www.meetup.com/Orange-County-Java-Users-Group-OCJUG)
about the Java Instrumentation API that powers the Contrast Java agent. The deck
is available
[on SpeakerDeck](https://speakerdeck.com/gilday/java-instrumentation-at-contrast-security)
This is a fun talk to give, because even to seasoned Java developers, the
esoteric Instrumentation API can feel like magic.
