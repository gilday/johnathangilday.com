title: ðŸ”’ XML External Entity Pitfalls With JAXB

  I spent a few weeks in "Java XML Hell", and I learned that securely parsing
  untrusted XML in Java is more difficult than it seems. Contrast Security

I work on a Java agent tool at Contrast Security that detects web application
vulnerabilities at runtime. Recently, Contrast reported an XML External Entities
(XXE) vulnerability in a user's web application that uses JAXB to parse XML. The
user questioned the validity of this vulnerability report. This user's false
positive claim sent me down the rabbit hole researching what I called Java XML
Hell. This research ultimately resulted in a change to
[OWASP's XXE Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
I discovered that securing JAXB against XXE attacks is really difficult, and the
Contrast Java agent accurately reported the application to be vulnerable ðŸ™Œ.

Before accepting our proposed changes, the OWASP XXE Cheat Sheet advised OpenJDK
1.8 users that their JAXB applications are safe from XXE attacks. The advice
read:

> Since JDK-8010393, which is in OpenJDK 8 beta 86,
> `javax.xml.bind.Unmarshaller` instances are safe by default. The other classes
> mentioned here are still unsafe by default in Java 8.

While researching this issue, I discovered that an application parsing untrusted
XML on an OpenJDK 1.8 runtime may be vulnerable to XXE when:

- the JAXB runtime has been inadvertently replaced with a different JAXB runtime
  that is not safe-by-default (e.g. EclipseLink MOXy)
- the secure SAX parser that the OpenJDK 1.8 `Unmarshaller` uses has been
  inadvertently replaced with a different implementation that is not
  safe-by-default (e.g. xercesImpl:2.8.0)
- the application uses one of the `unmarshal` overloads that does not delegate
  XML parsing to the safe-by-default SAX parser

Given all of these caveats, I do not think that OpenJDK 1.8 users should assume
that their JAXB `Unmarshaller` is safe from XXE attacks by default.

Contrast Security
[published my research to its Security Influencer's blog](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/security-influencers/xml-xxe-pitfalls-with-jaxb),
and
[OWASP accepted my change request](https://github.com/OWASP/CheatSheetSeries/issues/488)
to remove the misleading guidance from its XXE Cheat Sheet.

This is not the first time I have written about securing XML and Java. Last
year, I wrote an article for Baeldung about how to
[secure XStream from Remote Code Exploitation](https://www.baeldung.com/java-xstream-remote-code-execution).
One thing I have learned at Contrast Security is that tracing the relationships
between the various Java XML technologies and how to secure them is enough to
make anyone's head spin!
